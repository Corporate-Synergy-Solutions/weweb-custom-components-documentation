# Introduction

## What is weweb

Weweb is a no-code web-app builder where you can drag-and-drop different customizable blocks.

Every time you hit publish, we build a JavaScript (Vue.js) application.

Then, we prerender each page from it that we host on a content delivery network. Search engines can load them fast and read them easily, improving SEO and overall user-experience.

## Why custom component?

Weweb comes with a fair amount of pre-build component supported by their team which most users would be happy to just use them.

Some users have different needs for their business, they might want greater control over behaviour and appearance so they can implement their unique design and branding, or they need to implement their customized business model which pre-built component is not suitable for these use case.
